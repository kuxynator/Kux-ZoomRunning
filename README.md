# Kuxynator's Zoom-Running

Running speed depends on zoom level. Zoom out to run faster, zoom in to run slower. NOW without cheating.
Very useful when multiple exoskeletons installed or even without (with cheat).

## New in v2.1

The cheat mode is now optional, by default its turned off now. The player can activate/deactive the cheat mode (if available for this map) for itself in the player setting. An admin can activate the availability of the cheat in the map setting.  

The Hover-mode (cheat) can be enabled/disabled for all players in the startup settings. (due technical reasons)

[Satisfactorio](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Satisfactorio):
- The max zoom out level is limited (to Vanilla value) by default. This can be disabled (cheat) in the user setting.
